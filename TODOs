Adjust the 'calculate' function to either reject or calculate when Unums use a
fraction length that is much longer than 64 bits

Make a checklist of all of the properties() function that we need to implement
And make sure those are complete.

Go through all of the places where we have to recalculate the fsize and make
sure those use the __minimum_data_width function

Annotate all functions with {ESS,FSS} signature

Go through and make use of double underscore functions consistent, including
changing unum_unsafe to just __unum

go through and make sure max_esize and max_fsize are well-used.

make sure is_strange_subnormal is well-used

repair min() and max() functions so that they take into account ulps

repair mult_exact.
